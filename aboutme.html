<div class="grid-item5"><h3>Who Am I?</h3></div>

<div class="grid-item6"><p>I  am a first-year Master's Student at the University of Michigan School of Information, specializing in UX Design/Research/Human Computer Interaction. I currently work across all phases of the user experience process from research, user testing, consulting and prototyping and have applied this methodology across various industries including local government, higher education and waste management.</p>

<p>I also have a dual Bachelor's degree in Telecommunications and Communication & Culture from Indiana University where I focused on human behavior and its relationship with traditional media and technology.</p>

<p>In between my Midwest-stints I spent 5-years in the AdTech startup industry where I studied the operation from the ground up starting as a Technical Account Coordinator triaging platform issues and working my way up as a Business Development Manager where I combined my technical and client-facing skills to operate as a consultant for major retailers globally.  By the end of my tenure, I grew a side-task I acquired as an entry-level associate into a full-fledged platform product that currently commands well over 10% of the company's total revenue and has spanned across 3 continents.</p></div>

<div class="grid-item7"><h3>My Design Philosophy</h3></div>

<div class="grid-item8"><p>Throughout my education and career, I have remained passionate about accessibility and ensuring that people of all backgrounds are able to access and interact with systems indiscriminately.</p>

<p>I believe that good design should be like a good friend, conscientious, unassuming, and dependable.</p>

<p>"Design is not just what it looks like and feels likes. It's how it works." - Steve Jobs</p></div>
