<h1>CenterCycle Source</h1>

<h3>Challenge</h3>
	<p>Identify a contemporary issue and provide a unique solution that can be readily adapted using technology available today</p>

<h3>Inspiration</h3>
	<p>With rising urgency from scientists to environmentalists, citizens are eager to do their part to help slow down the clock on climate change.</p>

	<p>But what exactly does "their part" mean?</p>

	<p>From my experience, this varies city by city, each presenting its own limitations, but all uniformly lacking adequate access to recycling educational and services.</p>

	<p>I was ready to tackle that head on.</p>

<h3>It's not just me right?</h3>

	<h4>Context</h4>
		<p>To understand the breadth of the issue, I conducted background research and user survey and interviews</p>

	<h4>Research</h4>
		<p>What I found through research is that despite recycling being a ubiquitous presence in conversations about the environment, we are all doing it wrong.</p>

		<p>Researchers have found that a majority of us are misinformed about the proper recycling process and have unintentionally participated in recycling in such a way that has had negative consequences.</p>
 
	<h4>User Survey & Interviews</h4>
		<p>To gather additional perspective, I conducted a user survey (left) that was distributed across individuals between 25- 40 years old across the United States. I was also able to get permission from a handful of those surveyed to conduct phone interviews to discuss their responses and provide additional details.</p>

	<h4>Findings</h4>
		<p>The results of the survey and interviews confirmed the public misinformation regarding proper recycling habits with the average participant answering less than 50% of the questions correctly.</p>

		<p>Participants stressed that despite having a strong desire to be more environmentally conscious, the biggest obstacle was dealing with the lack of local recycling resources in their area. Fewer than half of the participants** reported having access to a consistent recycling resource at-home, with most participants stating that work was their main source for recycling.</p>

		<p>For participants without access to municipal-run recycling services, many stated that to participate they would need to pay for these services out-of-pocket along with carrying out their own research into recycling providers. This process, many said required more time and money than they could dedicate to the cause and therefore prevented them from looking into their options.</p>

		<p>**The survey spanned across different areas (south, midwest, and east coast) and neighborhoods (urban, suburban, and mid-size city)</p>

	
<h3>Is anyone else doing anything about this?</h3>

	<h4>Context</h4>
		<p>With the confirmation of demand for improved recycling education and access, I needed to understand what solutions exist today. For a problem everyone recognizes but has not solved, what are the gaps still present and how can we close it?</p>

	<h4>Competitor Analysis</h4>
		<p>To understand where the gaps are I ran a competitor analysis of organizations and companies aiming to reduce waste and increase access to sustainable practices.</p>

		<p>What I consistently found by the end of my research were the obstacles preventing survey participants from even attempting to coordinate their own recycling pickups:</p>

			<ol>
				<p>• Resources were hard to find using basic search phrases</p>
				<p>• Even harder to find? What these resources did once you found them</p>
				<p>• Trying to figure out if they serve your area? The answer will come to you in no less than 10 clicks and much rooting around</p>
				<p>• Once you've finally reached that serendipitous moment in which the company not only serves your purpose but also your area, it is almost always often followed up by a staggering price tag</p>
			</ol>

		<p>What I found by the end is that the survey participants were right to feel defeated from the start. Finding access to proper recycling education and pickup was a large investment.</p>

		<p>Too large. When you consider the alternative for most folks is "free" and exceedingly convenient: the trash bin.</p>

<h3>People May Buy Into the Why But the How is a Close Second</h3>

	<h4>Context</h4>
		<p>Now armed with the understanding that providing recycling resources is being carried out by companies, I set my focus on how people could access these services. The issue with recycling accessibility, it appeared to me, had less to do with a lack of options but a lack of opportunity.</p>

	<h4>Needfinding Solutions</h4>
		<p>Having assessed the gap between what users need and what companies are currently offering, I set out to ideate through sketching as that was a quick and nimble way of generating a number of ideas before taking next steps.  I compiled (8) different ideas (see slideshow on the right for all 8 sketches) that sought to provide recycling education and access where users already were and did not require additional effort from them without an incentive.  One idea was to have users use a central app that required users to input their address and schedule a pickup from a local recycling department.  This is one of the ways in which I thought to address the lack of private recycling services while reducing the effort citizens reported needing to undertake to partake in recycling pick-ups in their area.</p>

	<h4>Personas</h4>
		<p>To validate that the sketch solutions had a valid audience and purpose, I set out to define the personas that the product intended to target and one anti-persona that the product was not intended for.  The personas were an amalgamation of different user types that emerged from the survey and interview process.  Across all the respondents and the personas, is a desire for people to get more involved in the recycling process with differing ideas and commitment levels of that involvement. Respondents were interested in increasing their involvement for a number of reasons including social pressure, wanting to provide a better environmental future for their children, continuing their access to recycling habits after a move and just wanting to be more sustainable in all aspects of their life.  All of these desires and motivations were reflected into the personas created and placed them into familiar scenarios that the end product could address.  These personas served as the metric for what the priorities and end-goal of the resulting product would be.</p>

	<h4>Story Mapping</h4>
		<p>The story mapping exercise was done to walk through each plausible user journey of a given sketch solution for an applicable persona.  The goal of the exercise was to test a sketch solution's validity and purpose against a potential audience and scenario to see whether the product served the audience efficiently and successfully.  The exercise was carried out 5 times, each persona received 1-2 products that would be relevant for their goals and interests and outlined the scenario of using that product(s).  At the end, one final story map was created to find the commonalities within the different persona's respective user journeys and in their challenges.  What emerged was that all users could in some way find value and and interest in products that allowed them to control when, where and how they could participate in the recycling process. The key to helping people recycle more  (and properly) was to give them not only the access to it, but also the agency to act on it.</p>

	<h4>Design Defense</h4>
		<p>The Design Defense exercise was the point in the design process in which the final product began to take shape.  Through the story mapping solutions, the critical features emerged and were placed into a Product Roadmap where the user journey was mapped out to chart an efficient way for users to navigate from point A to point B.  This led to the creation of (3) user journeys, a private recycling pickup service, an informational quiz to incentivize and educate users on recycling and an online portal that helps socialize and gamify recycling amongst users.</p>

		<p>Critical Feature Selection, also known as QOC (Questions, Options, Criteria) was where critical user points within the product emerged and different design options were presented to give varying priorities.  The goal here was to strike a design balance so that users could be more educated and have better access to recycling with the least amount of effort.  It was during this exercise that I had to think through what areas of the product should I lean on being a comprehensive resource and which areas should I lean on efficiency and reducing the touch points.  Ultimately, this yielded (3) different scenarios that showcased this balance and justifications for each option to further assess the impact of these tradeoffs on the final product and overall mission.</p>

	<h4>Paper Prototype</h4>
		<p>The paper prototype was done to generate a low-fidelity prototype of one of the products of the solution.  I focused on the Recycling Pickup product as my sole focus for the rest of the semester (due to time constraints we were tasked with focusing on one product).  I chose to focus on the Recycling Pickup product as this was the most commonly requested service that users were interested in and would produce the highest level of impact compared to the quiz and social components of the website.</p>

		<p>When designing the paper prototype, I decided to prioritize efficiency and timeliness for the user and created forced-choice displays to allow the users to intuitively and quickly navigate through the request process.</p>

		<p>This prototype was then tested by users to gather additional feedback on its usability.  What emerged at this stage was a need to include options for users to revisit and edit their choices during the process and a need to provide visual cues when a change has been made post-confirmation.</p>

	<h4>Digital Prototype V1</h4>
		<p>The digital prototype was created using Adobe XD and addressed the feedback that was gathered from the paper prototype.  Additionally, the number of touch points to complete a user journey was also tabulated to understand the level of effort needed by the user and to see if there were areas of efficiencies that could be addressed.</p>

		<p>This prototype was then tested by users to gather additional usability feedback.  The feedback gathered at this stage was to maintain the service pickup scheduler as pop-up rather than a new page to be more palatable to the user.  Another piece of feedback that was presented was maintaining the order of the bottom buttons to prevent unwanted changes and maintain continuity.</p>

		<p>Overall, users found the product fairly straightforward to use and required few instructions to complete their journey.</p>

	<h4>Digital Prototype Final</h4>
		<p>The final prototype was created using Adobe XD and addressed the feedback that was gathered from the original digital prototype. This was then presented to instructors and peers as part of a product demo.  The issues stated within the first two-rounds of feedback were addressed</p>

		<p>The feedback received from this version was to improve the products accessibility by choosing a greater variety of colors that would allow users to distinguish the different site elements and texts more clearly.</p>

		<p>Overall, the product was well-received regarding its ability to deliver on the overall mission and being an intuitive platform.</p>

<h3>Retrospective</h3>

	<p>The retrospective provides an overview of:</p>

		<ol>
				<p>• The design process outlined above</p>
				<p>• Key product features</p>
				<p>• The most important design decision</p>
				<p>• Product assessment based on Ram's 10 Principles of Good Design</p>
				<p>• he challenges and opportunities the product addresses</p>
			</ol>

		<p>Overall, the product delivered on its mission to provide an accessible resource for people to responsibly grow their involvement within the recycling process. With additional time, more user tests would be conducted on the final digital prototype and the color accessibility issues would be addressed.</p>
