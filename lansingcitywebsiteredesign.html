<h1>Lansing City Website Redesign</h1>

<h3>Challenge</h3>
	<p>Help the City of Lansing Communications Department with the Lansing City website to make it the primary resource of information and communication for the city.  Currently, the Communications team serves as the main point of contact for general city inquiries resulting in a considerable amount of time spent personally addressing citizen queries by phone and email.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>
	<p>To help with the redesign of the City of Lansing website, a group of 4 students of the University of Michigan School of Information worked alongside the Lansing City Communications Department to produce a redesign proposal for the department to take to their service provider.</p>

	<p>The design process included research into past surveys, client consultation, competitor analysis, user surveys, usability tests, and prototyping.</p>

	<p>The proposal was then formally presented at the Lansing City Expo in front of the Lansing City Mayor and City Hall Staffers.  An informal presentation allowing the audience to view the research and prototype up-close and ask questions preceded the formal presentation</p>

	<p>At the end of the collaboration the Communications Department received a prototype of the redesigned website as well as a Sustainability Report providing them with the technical and logistical details (technical instructions, timelines, budgets, etc.) of all the proposed solutions.</p>

<h3>What does everyone think about this?</h3>

	<h4>Context</h4>
		<p>To understand the breadth of the issue, our team conducted background research, usability tests and user surveys.</p>

	<h4>Research</h4>
		<p>The team used Google Analytics and a 2018 user survey the Lansing City Communications Department carried out to understand historical user behavior on the current website.</p>

		<p>Google Analytics reported findings from the last year (October 2018 - September 2019) showing high bounce rates and users spending just a small amount of time per session. Additionally, the team found that many of its users came to the Lansing website through third party search engines. Analyzing the organic user behavior and navigation shaped the team’s proposal by quantifying the stickiness of the website and its current relationship to users on their research journey. The findings provided  the team a quantifiable baseline to measure the proposal's success.</p>

		<p>The Department-run 2018 survey revealed that users provided a slightly-above average rating on the website. Additionally, users reported using the navigation route on the site for their research a majority of the time compared to the search functionality. However, despite the high rate of self-reported navigation bar users, respondents noted the information architecture as an area for improvement with one user noting, “every time I need information it is a process of search and clicking until I locate the applicable information”. In analyzing the 2018 survey results, the team was able to drill down which aspects of the website more specifically were proving to be ineffective for users, which in this case appeared to be both the information architecture and the search bar.</p>
 
	<h4>User Survey & Usability Interviews</h4>
		<p> The team conducted a usability test and survey of the current website to get an understanding of how users were navigating on the site for a specific task and what user expectations were for the website. For the usability test, we asked users to navigate to the “Trash” and “Recycling” pages to find the trash pickup day for their neighborhoods.</p>

		<p>Consequently, we found that the user had a hard time locating the CART page on the website with the user going through the FAQ page to find a link that led to a broken page link that rendered no results which led the user to exit the site and use Google. Using a think-aloud method the user vocalized frustration at the unintuitive organization of the information throughout the test and difficulty achieving their goal.</p>

		<p>Conducting usability tests and a 2019 survey allowed the team to see a real-life example of the user journey on the site and also see the shifting sentiment towards the website as residents’ priorities and needs change.  The survey also revealed that the website rating dipped significantly as compared to the 2018 ratings.</p>

		<p>The findings from these studies framed the goal of the project to better meet the expectations of the residents (accessible resident data) and continue to understand the specific pain points within the site.</p>

<h3>What is Everyone Else Doing About This</h3>

	<h4>Context</h4>
		<p>Comparative analysis of other city websites (Boston, Charlotte, Bexar County) layouts were conducted to find commonalities and features that could elevate the user experience of the Lansing City website.</p>

	<h4>Comparative Analysis</h4>
		<p>Commonalities found across the three websites, but not found on the Lansing City website include a “Residents” page and a “Trending Topics” functionality. These features echo the user-reported interests and priorities of wanting easy access to resident-specific information along with the need to keep maintenance workload on departments to a minimum. In conducting the comparative analysis, the team was able to draw upon realistic and existing methods to address the needs and gaps of the current website.</p>

<h3>Where Do We Go From Here?</h3>

	<h4>Context</h4>
		<p>To arm the Lansing City Communications Department with a comprehensive and realistic set of proposals for their upcoming website redesign we worked with the team to look at previous attempts and gather their feedback throughout the design process.</p>

	<h4>Brainstorming Solutions</h4>
		<p>To understand the website's constraints, preferences, and history of solutions, the team drafted a number of potential solutions based on the research and feedback we had gathered thus far. The goal here was to generate as many ideas and methods as possible and present them to the client and get their feedback and potential hesitation on it to get a better understanding of what types of ideas they would lean towards (and therefore advocate for) and which ideas they either did not like or had hesitations about the logistics of it.  What we found during our meeting with them were a list of hidden needs behind their asks, the different solutions the team had previously taken, and the limitations (technical and office dynamics) of the website.</p>

		<p>Given the constraints and limitations of the solutions, we then asked the department to list out their choices for solutions and the reason behind them.  This then gave us the framework to work within a certain set of priorities, while giving us the breadth to explore the solutions we would propose (still keeping in mind the types of traits they gravitated towards).</p>

	<h4>Design Justification</h4>
		<p>Based on the surveys and client consultation, we put together a design justification outlining the areas to be addressed in our proposal along with justifications for their importance relative to the other findings.  In addition, we provided a scope for how to measure the success of the changes proposed.</p>

		<p>The prioritized changes proposed were:</p>

			<ol>
				<p>• Relocated & enlarged the search box to be the center-focus of the website</p>
				<p>• Incorporated FAQs section addressing questions across departments</p>
				<p>• Trending section that leverages site traffic data to provide shortcuts to the (real-time) popular pages</p>
				<p>• Re-labeled the sections to be more intuitive</p>
				<p>• Created a resident specific section to provide citizen-related content without having to navigate through department-specific pages</p>
			</ol>

		<p>These changes were drafted and prioritized given the feedback received stating that navigating around the site was challenging and unintuitive and resulted in users phoning or emailing the department directly instead.</p>

		<p>To measure the success of these proposals, the overall number of organic visitors should increase and bounce rate decrease to suggest that users are relying on the Lansing Website more frequently for information and are able to to stay on the website and find their information rather than bouncing off to a third-party search engine or contacting the department directly.</p>

		<p>Mockups were included to provide a visual rendering of the changes proposed and gather preliminary feedback.</p>

	<h4>Site Map Re-architecture</h4>
		<p>We recreated the information architecture of the website with its existing pages to reflect the new information structure in our proposal.  Due to the laws surrounding access to government information, we left all the existing pages on the website and opted to reorganize it in an intuitive way resembling other city websites.  As such, the new information architecture contains the "Residents Page" and "Business Page" to allow residents and entrepreneurs an easy way to gather information about the city.</p>

		<p>Additionally, the map was created as an Excel document instead of an infograph to allow the department team and service provider to use it directly during the website transition instead of having to manually recreate the document themselves.</p>

	<h4>Prototype</h4>
		<p>The prototype was created within Figma and reflects the updated information architecture, centralized search toolbar, and trending sections.  We also added a snow removal deadline urgent ribbon alert per the feedback from the Communications team to increase the visibility on the deadline as the city presently does not have an automated system to inform residents.  The ribbon alert provided the city a simple, scalable, and cost-efficient way to inform citizens.</p>

		<p>The prototype shows the improved experience by reducing the number of clicks to access the Snow Removal page from 5+ steps to just 3.</p>

		<p>Not pictured, but equally important to the Department, was the ability to blacklist sensitive content (e.g. arrest warrants) from appearing on the trending topic.</p>

<h3>Lansing City Hall Expo</h3>

<h4>Context</h4>
		<p>Student groups from the Citizen Interaction Design were given the opportunity to present their civic project proposals to an audience that included the Lansing City Mayor, their City Hall project stakeholders, and various other City Hall Staffers.  Each team was given the opportunity to deliver a formal 3-minutes presentation as well as participate in informal-discussions with the expo attendees through a convention-style program.</p>

<h4>Formal Presentation</h4>
		<p>I presented our proposal, highlighting how in a connected world, the Lansing City Website could improve by reducing the longwinded journey on their site to a more streamlined design to allow residents to spend less time navigating the site searching for city information, and more time enjoying the city's many offerings.</p>

		<p>We highlighted one particular user journey (snow removal) in which the current website requires no less than 5 steps for a user to get somewhere closer to the answer (but not the actual answer). However, with our proposal, the user would be able to get their exact answer in 3 clicks thanks to the intuitive design and architecture of our proposal.</p>

<h4>Expo Discussion & Feedback</h4>
		<p>Prior to the presentation, audience members were given 1-hour to cycle through the various civic project proposals to ask questions and provide feedback.</p>

		<p>Our team presented the issue of resident being unable to find important city information and highlighted the top 5 solutions in our proposal to provide a convenient and intuitive solution.</p>

		<p>We received positive feedback amongst the audience and our clients who felt we addressed the issues with the current website in a way that was scalable, financially feasible, and logistically viable.  The general sentiment we received from the audience was that they hoped the proposal would get approved as it would significantly help their workload.</p>

<h3>Sustainability Report</h3>

<h4>Context</h4>
		<p>The Sustainability Report was created as the final deliverable for the Lansing City Communication Department to provide them with all the materials needed for them to pitch the proposal internally including: Design Justification, Solutions Proposed, Project Timelines, Budget Amounts, Technical Instructions for Implementation, and all the resources (research, past deliverables, meeting notes, etc.) gathered during the project.</p>

		<p>Note that the proposals account for both implementation on current website and new website as the timeline for the new website is still being negotiated and may span into H2 2020, so the current website details were provided as an interim solution to accomodate.</p>

<h4>Details</h4>
		<p>The details regarding the technical execution, budget amounts, and scalability can be viewed in the report below.</p>

			<ol>
				<p>• Able to be implemented on current website at no additional cost </p>
				<p>• Able to be implemented on new website under any standard service provider agreement</p>
				<p>• Self-sustainable - to alleviate the issue of adding work onto staffers and quality standards</p>
			</ol>

		<p>Overall, the solutions proposed were intended to be cost-efficient, scalable, and non-custom development work to reduce the associated costs with the project and workload on the staffers.  With costs virtually reduced to $0 and minimal additional work to implement the changes (the content is either already available on current website or UMSI team has already done for the Communications Department), the proposed solutions are able to be implemented as soon as needed and provide relief and change to its users immediately.</p>
